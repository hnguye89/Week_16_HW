- Command for Zenmap to run a service scan against the Metasploitable machine: nmap -sV 192.168.0.10
 
- Bonus command to output results into a new text file named `zenmapscan.txt`: nmap -sV -oN zenmapscan.txt 192.168.0.10

- Zenmap vulnerability script command: nmap --script ftp-vsftpd-backdoor, smb-enum-shares 192.168.0.10
